# Common calendar

A calendar component for React.

### _React 0.13.x_ users:
There is React 0.13 supported version available from branch ~react-0.13~. N.B. this version does _not_ provide isomorphic component (react-dom removed).

## Documentation

This calendar is taken from [react-datepicker](http://hacker0x01.github.io/react-datepicker/). As react-datepicker did not expose calendar component but only the whole datepicker, this fork was created. For documentation see [https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker).
